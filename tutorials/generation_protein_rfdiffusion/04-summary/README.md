## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Issue: Poor Secondary Structure

**Solution**: Increase constraints in both RFdiffusion and MODELLER

### Issue: Unrealistic Sequences

**Solution**: Adjust ProteinMPNN temperature and analyse more designs

### Issue: Model Quality

**Solution**: Generate more models, refine thoroughly, check restraints

## Next Steps and Advanced Applications

### 1. Experimental Validation

- **Gene Synthesis**: Order DNA encoding your designed sequence
- **Expression**: Test in E. coli or cell-free systems
- **Biophysical Characterisation**: CD spectroscopy, thermal stability
- **Structure Determination**: NMR or X-ray crystallography

### 2. Design Optimization

```python
# Iterate on your design
for iteration in range(5):
    # 1. Analyze current design
    stability_score = calculate_stability(current_model)

    # 2. Identify weaknesses
    weak_regions = find_unstable_regions(current_model)

    # 3. Redesign problem areas
    new_sequence = redesign_regions(weak_regions)

    # 4. Rebuild and evaluate
    new_model = build_model(new_sequence)
```

### 3. Advanced Design Goals

- **Functional Designs**: Add binding sites or catalytic residues
- **Larger Structures**: Scale up to 100+ residue proteins
- **Protein Complexes**: Design multi-chain assemblies
- **Conditional Generation**: Design with specific properties

### 4. Alternative Tools to Explore

- **AlphaFold2**: Validate your designs with structure prediction
- **ColabDesign**: Inverse folding with AlphaFold
- **ESMFold**: Fast structure prediction
- **Rosetta**: Classical protein design suite
- **FoldX**: Energy calculations and mutations
