# EvoSite3D

A repository scripts and tutorials around molecular evolution and structural bioinformatics.

## Overview

EvoSite3D is designed to identify and analyse evolutionarily significant sites within protein
structures by integrating sequence evolution data with 3D structural information. These tools help
researchers understand the relationship between protein protein function and structural constraints.

## Features

- **3D Structure Analysis**: Visualise evolutionary sites in protein 3D structures
- **Sequence Evolution Integration**: Combine phylogenetic analysis with structural data
- **Conservation Scoring**: Calculate conservation scores for residue positions
- **Structural Context**: Analyse evolutionary pressures in different structural environments
- **Visualisation Tools**: Generate interactive 3D visualisations of evolutionary hotspots

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Tutorials:

- [Detecting pervasive positive selection with site-models from CodeML / PAML](./tutorials/pervasive_selection_site_models/)
- [Estimating the stability effect of a mutation with FoldX 5.1](./tutorials/stability_impact)
